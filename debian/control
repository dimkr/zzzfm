Description: Multi-panel tabbed file manager - GTK2 version
 zzzFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with
 built-in VFS, udev device manager, customizable menu system and
 bash integration.
 .
 zzzFM's UI is customizable (use Design Mode to change,
 and add to, the GUI as-you-go). The program is independent of particular
 desktop environments, and provides device management featureful enough to
 replace the various udisks-based *kits when used alongside udevil.
 .
 Other highlights include optional desktop management, smart queuing of
 file operations, and the ability to carry out specific commands as root.
 .
 If you would prefer a GTK+3 UI, Please install zzzfm-gtk3 instead.
